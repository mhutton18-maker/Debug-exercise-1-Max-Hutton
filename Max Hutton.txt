1.I would review the pseudocode step by step to understand the program. I would check the variable names, inputs, outputs, formulas, and 
loop conditions. I would also test the program using sample values to find mistakes.

 2. The developer could have planned the logic first using a flowchart or outline. They could have tested the program. I would check variable names, inputs, outputs, formulas, and loop conditions. I would also test their program using sample values to find mistakes.
